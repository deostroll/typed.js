            This is the Voyager 1 space probe ^1500 <br>
            It is the fastest man made object to wander space today ^1500 <br>
            And also the most distant object from earth
        </p>
        <p>
            Carl Sagan, a renowned astromer, and a popular science illustrutator,
            worked with the Voyager 1 imaging team. ^1000<br>
            In 1980, just before the space probe encounters the Saturnian system,
            Sagan proposed that Voyager turn its cameras to take one last picture 
            of earth
        </p>
        <p>He acknowledged that it might not have any scientific value,</p>
        <p>but it would be meaningful as a perspective on humanity's place in the
            universe...</p>
        <p>10 years later...Voyager 1's cameras turn towards the Sun...</p>
        <p>Behold....</p>
        <p>
            What follows shortly is one of the greatest speeches in the history of 
            the human species...
